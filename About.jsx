    Good and healthy foods reduce stress and promote healthy life without suffering. 
    Healthy foods help to maintain or improve overall health. Thus, it stands out of utmost
     importance to individuals to examine the significance of a healthy body.
     People eat junk foods and other unhealthy food items only for taste,
      neglecting the nourishment their bodies require. 
      They lack time to prioritize their well-being. By embracing good and healthy foods,
       individuals can reduce stress and lead fulfilling lives. The maintenance and 
       improvement of overall health depend significantly on consuming a balanced diet 
       rich in essential nutrients such as liquids, proteins, fatty acids, vitamins, minerals, and calories.
